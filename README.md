# Logic Building Questions

This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed to solve various algorithmic and logic-based problems.

## Problem List

*   **Question1.java**: **Sum of Digits** - Calculates the sum of all digits in a given number using recursion.
*   **Question2.java**: **Reverse Digits** - Reverses the order of digits in an integer.
*   **Question3.java**: **Prime Check** - Determines if a given positive integer is a prime number.
*   **Question4.java**: **Power Check** - Checks if a number `y` is a power of `x` (i.e., if $x^n = y$).
*   **Question5.java**: **Shortest Distance** - Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ on a 2D plane.
*   **Question6.java**: **Valid Triangle** - Determines if three given side lengths can form a valid triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem.
*   **Question7.java**: **Rectangle Overlap** - Checks if two rectangles defined by their top-left and bottom-right coordinates overlap.
*   **Question8.java**: **Factorial** - Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`.
*   **Question9.java**: **Palindrome Number** - Determines if an integer reads the same forward and backward.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Java installed. You can compile and run any specific file using the command line:

```bash
javac Question1.java
java Question1
```

Replace `Question1` with the specific class name you wish to run.
